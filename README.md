# Distributed_Island-Model_Genetic_Algorithms


# DESTRIBUTED IMPLEMENTATION OF GENETIC ALGORITHM USING ISLAND MODEL
## Description

This repository showcases a distributed implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) using the JADE (Java Agent Development Framework) platform. Multiple agents are created, with each agent independently performing its own GA to solve optimization problems. Explore the source code, documentation, and results to learn more about this distributed approach to evolutionary optimization.

## Configuration

Genetique algorithm parameters

```java

public class GAUtils {
    public static final String TARGET_PHRASE = "Yasser ELJARIDA";
    
    public static final int CHROMOSOME_SIZE = 15;
    
    public static final int POPULATION_SIZE = 50;
    
    public static final double MUTATION_PROBABILITY = 0.5;
    
    public static final int MAX_ITERATIONS = 2000;

    public static final String ALPHABET = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";

    public static final int ISLAND_NUMBER = 5;

}

```
